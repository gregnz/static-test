We’ve been rapidly growing our base of Premium Agents on Homes.co.nz, in fact we’ve seen 500% Premium Agent growth this year alone.


One of the biggest questions we get asked is how Homes.co.nz is changing the digital space for Real Estate.

The simplest answer is:

**We offer tools to buyers and vendors to connect with you on relevant data like home sales histories, HomesEstimates, RentEstimates and more.**

Rest assured, we’re working with agents to create a better digital space online. We believe that opening an easy forms of communication around data between vendors/buyers to agents is key to your success as an agent.

We had a chat with[ Steve Koerber,](https://homes.co.nz/app/agents/agent/ad8be6e5-a079-4e87-a374-e8b2edf3ffd4) One of Ray White Remuera’s top performing agents. We helped him achieve his best year ever this year.
