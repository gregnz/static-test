## Why claim your home with Homes.co.nz?
Claiming your home keeps you up to date with the current estimated value of your property and allows you to track how it has changed through monthly HomesEstimate changes. While the CV is calculated every three years, the HomesEstimate updates monthly via a similar algorithm, based on nearby sales data.

Additionally, claiming your home shows you the sales of similar properties in your area, their sale price and the agents involved. From here you can get in contact with local sales agents for a more detailed market appraisal or rent appraisal on your property.

## What is a Council Valuation?
The evaluation is completed every three years to determine the annual rates the home owner has to pay. The calculation takes into account the land area, location, zoning, building type, floor space and any consented work completed (Renovations, additional builds and subdivisions).

## How it affects you.
The capital valuation assesses an approximate market value of the property on the day of the evaluation. Itâ€™s made of the 2 major components.

1. Land Value. This is the estimated value of the bare land area of the property.
2. Improvement Value. This determines the estimate value of the building and land improvements that have added to the value of the bare land. The improvement value can be increased through renovation and restoration of property features.
